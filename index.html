        <h2>Shenelle Turner</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Shenelle Turner! I’m 20, and ever since my days as a young girl, I’ve been chasing passions 
            that let me express myself creatively. Whether it’s through writing scripts, stepping into a character’s 
            shoes as an actor, or just kicking back and giving commentary on movies and shows, I love engaging with storytelling 
            in all its forms. In my downtime, I like to tinker with coding projects, review different kinds of food (because who doesn’t 
            love a good meal?), and travel to new places for a fresh perspective. It’s all about exploring and sharing experiences that 
            bring a bit of excitement and flavor to life!.</p>
