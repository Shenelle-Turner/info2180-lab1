        <h2>Shenelle Turner</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Shenelle Turner! I’m 20, and ever since I was a young girl, I’ve been chasing passions 
            that let me express myself creatively. Whether it’s through writing scripts, stepping into a character’s 
            shoes as an actor, or offering commentary on movies and shows, I love engaging with storytelling in all its forms. 
            My interest in web development comes from the same place—it’s another avenue to create and share stories in an interactive 
            way. Building websites allows me to combine my coding skills with my love for creativity, crafting digital experiences that 
            can connect people. When I’m not coding or acting, I enjoy reviewing different foods and traveling to new places, always 
            looking for fresh perspectives and experiences to fuel my passions.</p>
